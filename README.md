# Power-BI-Project

**Video Games Sales Analysis Dashboard (2024) – Power BI Project**
**Project Overview**
This is my first BI (Business Intelligence) project, developed using Power BI. The aim of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive analysis of video game sales across different platforms, genres, publishers, and regions. This project allowed me to explore data cleaning, modeling, and interactive visual storytelling – skills that are foundational for any aspiring data analyst.
