# Power-BI-Project

**Video Games Sales Analysis Dashboard (2024) – Power BI Project**
**Project Overview**
This is my first BI (Business Intelligence) project, developed using Power BI. The aim of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive analysis of video game sales across different platforms, genres, publishers, and regions. This project allowed me to explore data cleaning, modeling, and interactive visual storytelling – skills that are foundational for any aspiring data analyst.

This bar chart showcases the Top Video Game Developers based on the total number of games developed. Built using Microsoft Power BI, the visualization helps identify the most prolific contributors in the gaming industry.
